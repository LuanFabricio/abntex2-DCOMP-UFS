	abstract = {Security is of utmost concern, whether it may be the security of data, assets and human life. With the development of technology, increasing use of IoT and biometrics authentication for security have gained popularity. Facial recognition is considered a universal, collectible, and accessible biometrics system. Biometric face recognition is based on the same identifier that humans use to distinguish one person from another. In this work, facial recognition has been considered to develop a highly reliable door lock system. Face-ID based security system has been developed using ESP32-CAM. The system performs real-time face detection and recognition, rapidly when a face is in front of camera. A prototype has been developed and tested, that evaluates the door lock system's working, efficiency, and reliability. The results show that it can be efficiently used to enhance human life and security and for commercial and residential purposes.}

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have been applied in many applications exhibiting extraordinary abilities in the field of computer vision. However, complex network architectures challenge efficient real-time deployment and require significant computation resources and energy costs. These challenges can be overcome through optimizations such as network compression. Network compression can often be realized with little loss of accuracy. In some cases accuracy may even improve. This paper provides a survey on two types of network compression: pruning and quantization. Pruning can be categorized as static if it is performed offline or dynamic if it is performed at run-time. We compare pruning techniques and describe criteria used to remove redundant computations. We discuss trade-offs in element-wise, channel-wise, shape-wise, filter-wise, layer-wise and even network-wise pruning. Quantization reduces computations by reducing the precision of the datatype. Weights, biases, and activations may be quantized typically to 8-bit integers although lower bit width implementations are also discussed including binary neural networks. Both pruning and quantization can be used independently or combined. We compare current techniques, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, present compressed network accuracy results on a number of frameworks, and provide practical guidance for compressing networks.}
